Brief trip to Montreal. The nightlife here is very amazing. I wish I stayed longer but it was still super enjoyable. The food in the bakeries are a bit overpriced, but out of this world.

<br />
It was hard to communicate and felt awkward at times. Shout out the bilingual people, i appreciate you
<br />
<br />
It's exactly like New York, which makes me want to move here in the future. This city will always be special.
