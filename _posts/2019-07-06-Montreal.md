Brief trip to Montreal. The nightlife here is very amazing. I wish I stayed longer but it was still super enjoyable. The food in the bakeries are a bit overpriced, but out of this world.

It was hard to communicate and felt awkward at times. Shout out the bilingual people, i appreciate you

In the words of my brother, Sydney, this is basically French New York, but cleaner. Who can say no to free healthcare? I'm definitely moving here
