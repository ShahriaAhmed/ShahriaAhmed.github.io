Brief trip to Montreal. The nightlife here is hella amazing. I wish I stayed longer but it was still super enjoyable. The food in the bakeries are a bit overpriced, but out of this world.
<br />
<br />
It was hard to communicate and felt awkward at times. Shout out the bilingual people, you the real heroes.
<br />
<br />
In the words of my brother, Sydney, this is basically French New York, but cleaner. They even had the crackhead in the corner to make you feel right at home. I'm def moving here.
