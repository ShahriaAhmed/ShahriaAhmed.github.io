Brief trip to Montreal. The nightlife here is a vibe. I wish I stayed longer but it was still super enjoyable. The food in the bakeries are a bit overpriced but out of this world.
<br />
<br />
Communicating was hard tho. Some people spoke english but most spoke with a thick French accent and it just felt weird.
<br />
<br />
In the words of my brother,Sydney, this is basically French New York. They even had the crackhead in the corner to make you feel right at home. I'm def moving here.
