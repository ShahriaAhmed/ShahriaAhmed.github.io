Flying from NYC to Bangladesh is probably the worst thing about traveling. I had to make a 13 hour connection flight to Dubai, wait another 8 hours and then take a 6 hour flight to Dhaka. From there, it was an 8 hour drive home. But it was worth it. <br />

My first time back home in 13 years damn. <br />
&nbsp;
It's been so long, a lot of my memories faded away and i would only have brief recollections in my dreams. Seeing everything again was weird. It felt familiar but different from the way I remembered. <br />
&nbsp;
This entire trip was super humbling and all around fun. I went from villages on mountains on the outskirts of the border of India to boat rides on a huge ass river to tea gardens. I didn't know my homeland was so nice but I also left when I was 5 so I never got to explore as much. <br />
