Flying from NYC to Bangladesh is probably the worst thing about traveling. I had to make a 13 hour connection flight to Dubai, wait another 8 hours and then take a 6 hour flight to Dhaka. From there, it was an 8 hour drive home. But it was worth it.

<br />

My first time back home in 13 years damn.
<br />
<br />

It's been so long, a lot of my memories faded away and i would only have brief recollections in my dreams. Seeing everything again was weird. It felt familiar but different from the way I remembered. I felt happy back at home, but an outsider at the same time. So many things had changed, but the morning air filled with dew was still just as I remembered it
<br />
<br />
This entire trip was super humbling and all around fun. I went from villages on mountainsides on the outskirts of the border of India to boat rides on a huge river, to tea gardens. I didn't know my homeland was so nice, but I also left when I was 5 so I never got to explore as much.
