We went to the domino sugar factory in Brooklyn before the area got gentrified to shit. The sugar factory was boarded up and looked like it was gonna be demolished and for good reasons.
<br />
<br />
 The floors were soft and could give away easily. I took one step on the roof and knew if I took another, I would fall straight through. That's when we knew we had to get out.
<br />
<br />
<br />

The factory is still up there today. The pictures could've been better, but I had a bad lens at the time which was terrible in low light.
