My second time back home. This was the most hectic and traumatizing one. I went through the same process, 13 hour flight to Dubai, except the layover was 14 hours. After finally getting through that, we left for the second 6 hour long flight home.
&nbsp;
Except there was a tornado at the airport where we were supposed to land. So we rerouted to another airport in Chitagong to refuel. The delay was another hour, but things were finally looking good.
&nbsp;
Except this passenger had a mental breakdown and started punching the plane window trying to break out. That guy got sedated and taken away. After another hour of waiting, we were ready to go.
&nbsp;
But now, there was a thunderstorm. The takeoff was a combination of lightning strikes, lots of shaking and grown men crying and praying for a safe flight. Shit at this point, if we die, we die.
&nbsp;
But we managed to land and finally got through the security and hassle of finding our luggage. The ride back home was another 6 hours at night and I started hallucinating cuz of the lack of sleep.
